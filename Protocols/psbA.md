## I. PCR
### PCR Preparation 
- thaw reagents & samples 
- UV & label PCR tubes
- make sure molecular water is alloquoted 
### Create master mix for each sample
*use this sheet to determine reagent volumes*

1. Add Buffer, dNTP, and Primers vortex to eppendorf tube. Vortex Briefly 
*(DO NOT vortex polymerase or albumin)*
2. Add polymerase and albumin. 
*albumin is viscous so pipet slowly*
3. Add water, pipette up and down to mix.
*Be careful not to make bubbles*
4. Pipette 24uL of master mix into each replicate tube
5. Pipette 1uL of DNA into each replicate tube
*use new pipette tip for each replicate*
4. briefly centrifuge pcr tubes before thermal cycler
5. run thermocycler program:
    1. 98 for 30 sec
    2. 98 for 10 sec
    3. 69 for 30 sec
    4. 72 for 20 sec _repeat 2-4 for 30 cycles (# of cycles varies depending on input)_
    5. 72 for 2 min
    6. 8 for Forever

# **ALL POST-PCR DONE IN OTHER ROOM (aka the rest of this protocol)**

## Gel electrophoresis 

### Gel electrophoresis preparation
- make sure there is enough 1x TBE buffer to make a gel
	*TBE Buffer 'Recipe' https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Protocols/blob/main/Molecular_labwork/TBE_Buffer_Protocol.md*
- always use standard DNA ladder on every row of gel, can dilute ladder to 1:5 in order to see relatively brighter bands

### Making and setting up a gel
1. Prepare gel mold to set up a gel- add gel comb for number of samples needed
2. mix agar and clean TBE buffer to generate a 1.5% agarose gel that will be large enough for the gel mold
3. calculating gel density:
    *% = weight (g) / volume (mL)*
4. melt mixture (on hot plate with stir bar or microwave) until mixture has big bubbles and there's no floaters
5. add GelRed to gel once cool to touch *(if you don't, you won't see your bands!!)*
6. Pour gel into the middle of mold and wait for even dispersion (enough gel to see that the wells are in it, not too thick
	*use a pipet tip to push away any bubbles* 
7. let gel cool *- wells will break if not cooled down enough - 20 mins to be safe

### Loading gel sample prep
1. Cut enough parafilm for all samples + ladders
2. Pipette up 20uL of loading dye and place 1-2ul dots of loading dye on the parafilm for each well
3. **turn rig so DNA will move towards the positive electrode run towards red!**
4. load 2-3uL of DNA ladder *(1:5 dilution with molecular water)* at beginning or end *(or both if large rig)* of the gel, and on each row
5. load 1uL PCR product- *mix sample thoughly with loading dye*
6. put cover on and turn on electric current - **run 110 volts for ~35 mins**
    - *check to make sure bands aren't running off the gel*
    - *time length depends on the size of gel 30-50 mins*
7. turn off electric current **then** remove lid
8. take picture of gel 
    - turn lights off in room, put gel on the glass and lift the cover (45 degrees) so that there is no reflection from the gel, take photo parallel to gel
    - editing: crop to be centered, brightness -100
    - *in some cases may run for longer to get more separation in bands*
9. you may reuse gels up to 3 times, if so, break the gel up into a glass container that can be covered and store at 2-8 °C 
	*make sure to label how many times the gel was used on the lid*
