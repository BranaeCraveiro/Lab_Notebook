*Decreased extension time from 1 minute to 30 seconds, and number of cycles from 40 to 38. Set up one reaction with 1 uL of DNA, one with 2 uL, and one with 4 uL*.

**Sample 1:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T3_39_CNAT (14.2 ng/μL)
**Sample 2:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T2_55_CNAT (9.56 ng/μL)
*note: weird ordering of samples in my gel since one of my lanes had a bubble and I was trying to avoid it*

*Notes: embarrassingly I believe I made the same mistake I made on [7.21.2025 - annealing gradient](7.21.2025%20-%20annealing%20gradient.md) where I added my reverse primer twice and did not add any forward primer. This was definetly because I was feeling under the weather but was my last wet lab work day before vacation so I pushed myself to come in- lesson learned. will retry this same experimental set up next experiment.

1. Add Buffer, dNTP, and Primers vortex to eppendorf tube. Vortex Briefly 
*(DO NOT vortex polymerase or albumin)*
2. Add polymerase and albumin. 
*albumin is viscous so pipet slowly*
3. Pipette 5.25 µL of master mix to each pcr tube.
4. Add 18.75 µL of water to the 1 uL & negative control tubes, pipette up and down to mix.
5. 4. Add 17.75 µL of water to the 2 uL tubes, pipette up and down to mix.
6. Add 15.75 µL of water to the 4 uL tubes, pipette up and down to mix.
7. Pipette DNA into each tube
*use new pipette tip for each tube*
8. briefly centrifuge pcr tubes before thermal cycler
9. run thermocycler program: *38 cycles takes ~ 2 hours
    1. 95°C for 30 seconds
    2. 95°C for 30 seconds
    3. 46°C for 1 minute
    4. 68°C for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">30 seconds</mark> _repeat 2-4 for 38 cycles (# of cycles varies depending on input)
    5. 68°C for 5 minutes
    6. 6°C for Forever
