*now using Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase instead of Q5 Hot Start*
**Row 1:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T3_39_CNAT (14.2 ng/μL)
**Row 2:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T2_55_CNAT (9.56 ng/μL)
*Note: Lane C is a sample from Caroline's pooled 16s samples that she wanted to double check* 

*Notes:*
- *ideal temperature either 45 or 46°C.* 
- *Band appearing around 300/400 bp might be psbAncr region. However Thornhill & Lajuenesse 2011, (10.1371/journal.pone.0029013) states that their psbAncr sequence was about 500 to 600 bp.*
- *Not sure what the top band (~1500 bp) is in samples? Surprised how the bright the band is across all temperatures? Not sure what is going on* 
	- *the 1500 bp band is also on July 23 gel ([[7.23.2025 - troubleshooting]]) however is it limited to the a specific temperature range and is much fainter*
- *Used 2 uL of DNA extraction and 40 cycles but bands are still faint?*
## Determining annealing temperature range
https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main 
**Primer 1**
25 nt  
44% GC  
Tm: 57°C

**Primer 2**
22 nt  
45% GC  
Tm: 55°C

**Anneal at** 50 °C

*try annealing gradient between 45°C - 55°C*

1. Add Buffer, dNTP, and Primers vortex to eppendorf tube. Vortex Briefly 
*(DO NOT vortex polymerase or albumin)*
2. Add polymerase and albumin. 
*albumin is viscous so pipet slowly*
3. Add water, pipette up and down to mix.
*Be careful not to make bubbles*
4. Pipette 24µL of master mix into each replicate tube
5. Pipette 1µL of DNA into each replicate tube
*use new pipette tip for each replicate*
6. briefly centrifuge pcr tubes before thermal cycler
7. run thermocycler program:
    1. 95 for 30 seconds
    2. 95 for 30 seconds
    3. 45-55 for 1 minute
    4. 68 for 1 minute _repeat 2-4 for 40 cycles (# of cycles varies depending on input)
    5. 68 for 5 minutes
    6. 6 for Forever
