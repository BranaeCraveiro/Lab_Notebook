*testing to see if my primers are working by using Caroline's reagents (we know they work since she has been using them for her project) and my psbA primers* 

***changes to protocol**: gradient lowest temperature of 55 °C and running PCR for 40 cycles based off the methods from the paper I got my primers from (Thornhill & Lajuenesse 2011, 10.1371/journal.pone.0029013 )*

**Row 1:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T3_39_CNAT (14.2 ng/μL)
**Row 2:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T2_55_CNAT (9.56 ng/μL)

*Notes: 60.9°C seems like the optimal temperature. Despite upping cycles from 30 to 40 bands are faint, may need to consider upper cycles even more or loading more uL of DNA in each reaction tube.* 

### Next Steps
- Sarah order a new polymerase, will need to do a new temperature gradient with the kits new temperature range

| Albumin         | 0.25                  | 4.4                         |
| Total           | 25                    | 440                         |

1. Add Buffer, dNTP, and Primers vortex to eppendorf tube. Vortex Briefly 
*(DO NOT vortex polymerase or albumin)*
2. Add polymerase and albumin. 
*albumin is viscous so pipet slowly*
3. Add water, pipette up and down to mix.
*Be careful not to make bubbles*
4. Pipette 24uL of master mix into each replicate tube
5. Pipette 1uL of DNA into each replicate tube
*use new pipette tip for each replicate*
6. briefly centrifuge pcr tubes before thermal cycler
7. run thermocycler program:
    1. 98°C for 30 sec
    2. 98°C for 10 sec
    3. 55-70°C for 30 sec
    4. 72°C for 20 sec _repeat 2-4 for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">40 cycles</mark> (# of cycles varies depending on input)_
    5. 72°C for 2 min
    6. 8°C for Forever

## Annealing Temperature Gradient Key 
**A**: 70°C
**B**: 68.9°C
**C**: 67.1°C
**D**: 64.4°C
**E**: 60.9°C
**F**: 58.5°C
**G**: 56.4°C
**H**: 55°C
