## Jan 15 2026 Gel Image  
*I lost track count between samples 8-9 I accidentally skipped a well and then confused myself. I put sample 8 were sample 9 was suppose to go then I might of t put sample 9 in sample 8 (since I swapped them I was putting 9 where it was supppose to go lol). Then I kept spirally and I became unconfident on where I put part of sample 10 (might of put some in the negative). Will ask caroline if I should rerun them before cleaning if they come out good.

notes:* 
- *DNA in negative was a gel loading issue and not a pcr issue*
- *the smearing is marginally better which is awesome but not clear enough for a bead cleanup; except for sample 4 which has a clear band (I think this is due to the samples lower conc.)*
#### Next Steps: 
- will try reducing the cycle count from 35 to 
## PCR Preparation 
### Create master mix for each sample

| Reagent         | Amount per 1 rxn (uL) | MasterMix Amount (uL) + 10% |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Buffer          | 2.5                   | 30.25                       |
| dNTP (10mM)     | 0.5                   | 6.05                        |
| F Primer (10uM) | 1                     | 12.1                        |
| R Primer (10uM) | 1                     | 12.1                        |
| DNA             | 2                     | 24.2                        |
| Polymerase      | 0.125                 | 1.5125                      |
| Water           | 17.75                 | 214.775                     |
| Albumin         | 0.125                 | 1.5125                      |
| Total           | 25                    | 302.5                       |
1. Add Buffer, dNTP, and Primers vortex to eppendorf tube. Vortex Briefly 
*(DO NOT vortex polymerase or albumin)*
2. Add polymerase and albumin. 
*albumin is viscous so pipet slowly*
3. Add water, pipette up and down to mix.
*Be careful not to make bubbles*
4. Pipette 22µL of master mix into each replicate tube
*make sure to mix master mix each time*
5. Pipette 2µL of DNA into each replicate tube
*use new pipette tip for each replicate*
6. briefly centrifuge pcr tubes before thermal cycler
7. run thermocycler program: *40 cycles takes 2 hours and 26 minutes*
    1. 95°C for 30 seconds
    2. 95°C for 30 seconds
    3. 53.6°C for 1 minute
    4. 68°C for 1.5 minutes *repeat 2-4 for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">35 cycles*</mark> 
    5. 68°C for 5 minutes
    6. 8°C for Forever
