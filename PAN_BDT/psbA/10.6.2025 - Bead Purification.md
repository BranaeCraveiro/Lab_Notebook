*I made my gel on Oct. 8th, submerged it with TBE buffer and placed in the fridge so I could load and run my gel quickly the next day. However, my buffer and gel froze. I let it thaw for an hour, then loaded and ran my gel.*

*Notes: Will try again with a fresh gel (and will make sure to not put it inthe fridge lol)

# All done in the Post PCR Room
## Purification with ampure beads
*link to # Bead to Sample Ratio for size selection https://www.beckman.com/reagents/genomic/cleanup-and-size-selection/pcr/bead-ratio* 
### Purification Preparation
- obtain, label, and cross-link new strip tubes start with the manufacturer protocol using 1.8X-1.0X DNA to bead ratio and 10uL-25uL PCR product 
- ratio of beads will change the size you select for 
	*may need to re-clean samples if gel images show that multiple bands were not removed*
	- *1.0x will get rid of <200 bp dimers, 1.8X will get rid of dimer <100 bp* 
- all calculations can be done here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_NJCFvnBztKm_G88Sx-gEKD7CwR44iEaRjyxS_N32E/edit?gid=1947158502#gid=1947158502](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_NJCFvnBztKm_G88Sx-gEKD7CwR44iEaRjyxS_N32E/edit?gid=1947158502#gid=1947158502)

### Purification 
1. make fresh 80% ethanol in a 50mL tube (label and parafilm when not in use)
    - paste filled out table here

| Number of Samples | 80% EtOH for each sample (uL) | Total 80% EtoH needed (uL) | Volume 100% EtOH (uL) | Volume H2O (uL) |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| 4                 | 360                           | 1440                       | 1152                  | 288             |
|                   |                               | in mL                      |                       |                 |
|                   |                               | 1.44                       | 1.152                 | 0.288           |

2. Determine whether or not a plate transfer is necessary. If the PCR reaction volume multiplied by 2.8 exceeds the volume of the PCR plate, a transfer to larger tubes is required.
3. Gently shake the Clean NGS Mag PCR Clean-up aliquot to resuspend any Magnetic particles that may have settled.
    1. Add CleanNGS Mag PCR Clean-up volume table below:

| Sample | Bead Concentration | PCR volume (uL) | Added beads volume (uL) | Total # Samples     | Total Bead Volume (uL) |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1-3    | 1.8                | 20              | 36                      | 3                   | 108                    |
| 4      | 0.6                | 20              | 12                      | 1                   | 12                     |
|        |                    |                 |                         | **Total beads vol** | 120                    |
**Note:** The volume of CleanNGS Mag PCR Clean-up for a given reaction can be determined from the following equation:  
_(Volume of Mag Beads per reaction) = (Bead Concentration) x (PCR Reaction Volume)_

3. Mix reagent and PCR reaction thoroughly by pipette mixing 5 times.
4. Incubate the mixed samples for 5 minutes at room temperature for maximum recovery. 
	*This step allows the binding of PCR products 125bp (based on concentration) and greater to the Magnetic beads. After mixing, the color of the mixture should appear homogenous.*
5. Place the reaction plate onto a 96 well Magnet Plate for 3 minutes or wait until the solution is clear.
	*Wait until the solution is clear before proceeding to the next washing step. Otherwise there may be beads loss.*
6. Aspirate the cleared solution from the reaction plate and discard
	*This step must be performed while the reaction plate is placed on the 96 magnetic plate. Avoid disturbing the settled magnetic beads. If beads are drawn into tips, leave behind a few microliters of solution.*
7. Dispense **180 uL of 80% ethanol** to each well of the reaction plate and incubate for **1 min** at room temperature. 
8. Aspirate out the ethanol and discard. Repeat for a total of two washes. 
	*It is important to perform these steps with the reaction plate on a 96 well Magnetic Plate. Do not disturb the settled Magnetic beads.*
    1. Remove all of the ethanol from the bottom of the well to avoid ethanol carryover. 
	    *Bump pipette tip up to 200 uL, may need to use p20 multichannel*
    2. **NOTE:** *A 5 min air dry at room temperature is recommended for the evaporation of the remaining traces of ethanol.* **Do not overdry the beads** *(the layer of settled beads appears cracked) as this will significantly decrease elution efficiency.*
9. Take off the plate from the Magnetic plate, add 40 uL of elution buffer (Reagent grade water, TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, or TE buffer) to each well of the reaction plate and pipette mix 5 times.
    *mix until homogeneous and there are no beads on tube wall*
10. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
11. Place the plate on a magnetic separation device to magnetize the CleanNGS particles. 
12. Incubate at room temperature until the CleanNGS particles are completely cleared from solution.
13. Transfer the cleared supernatant containing purified DNA and/or RNA to a new (RNase-free) 96-well microplate and seal with non-permeable sealing film.
14. Store the plate at 2-8°C if storage is only for a few days. For long-term storage, samples should be kept at -20°C.

## Gel electrophoresis 

### Gel electrophoresis preparation
- make sure there is enough 1x TBE buffer to make a gel
	*TBE Buffer 'Recipe' https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Protocols/blob/main/Molecular_labwork/TBE_Buffer_Protocol.md*
- always use standard DNA ladder on every row of gel, can dilute ladder to 1:5 in order to see relatively brighter bands

### Making and setting up a gel
1. mix agar and clean TBE buffer to generate a 1.5% agarose gel that will be large enough for the gel mold
	*small gel mold: 25 mL
	medium gel mold: 50 mL
	large gel mold: 75 mL*
2. calculating gel density:
    *% = weight (g) / volume (mL)*
3. Prepare gel mold to set up a gel- add gel comb for number of samples needed
4. melt mixture (on hot plate with stir bar or microwave) until mixture has big bubbles and there's no floaters
5. add 2 µL GelRed to gel once cool to touch *(if you don't, you won't see your bands!!)*
6. Pour gel into the middle of mold and wait for even dispersion (enough gel to see that the wells are in it, not too thick
	*use a pipet tip to push away any bubbles* 
7. let gel cool *- wells will break if not cooled down enough - 20 mins to be safe

### Loading gel sample prep
1. Cut enough parafilm for all samples + ladders
2. Pipette up 20µL of loading dye and place 1-2µL dots of loading dye on the parafilm for each well
3. **turn rig so DNA will move towards the positive electrode run towards red!**
4. load 2-3µL of DNA ladder *(1:5 dilution with molecular water)* at beginning or end *(or both if large rig)* of the gel, and on each row
5. load 1µL PCR product- *mix sample thoughly with loading dye*
6. put cover on and turn on electric current - **run 110 volts for ~35 mins**
    - *check to make sure bands aren't running off the gel*
    - *time length depends on the size of gel 30-50 mins*
7. turn off electric current **then** remove lid
8. take picture of gel 
    - turn lights off in room, put gel on the glass and lift the cover (45 degrees) so that there is no reflection from the gel, take photo parallel to gel
    - editing: crop to be centered, brightness -100
    - *in some cases may run for longer to get more separation in bands*
9. you may reuse gels up to 3 times, if so, break the gel up into a glass container that can be covered and store at 2-8 °C 
	*make sure to label how many times the gel was used on the lid*
