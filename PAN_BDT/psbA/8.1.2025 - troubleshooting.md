*Decreased extension time from 1 minute to 30 seconds, and number of cycles from 40 to 38. Set up one reaction with 1 uL of DNA, one with 2 uL, and one with 4 uL*.
- *retry of [7.30.2025 - troubleshooting](7.30.2025%20-%20troubleshooting.md)*

**Sample 1:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T3_39_CNAT (14.2 ng/μL)
**Sample 2:** 92022_PAN_BDT_T2_55_CNAT (9.56 ng/μL)

*Notes:* 
- *On sample 2_4uL there is a faint band at 600 bp woot woot!!!! I wonder why sample one did not show the band as sample 2 had a lower initial concentraction than sample 1. Maybe there is not enough symbiont DNA (so more host DNA) in sample 1.*
- *Also at higher concentrations my nonspecific binding is no longer showing (strong ~1000 - 1500 bp band at top of lanes), very exciting!* 
### Next Steps 
*from [Summer 2025](../../Notes/Meeting%20Notes/Summer%202025.md) meeting notes under "8/1/2025 w/ Sarah"*
- Srarah says we want more DNA and higher temp (annealing temp)
- can do a gradient of this temp and higher and maybe try 4 ul 5 ul and 6 ul of DNA?
	- if I do this will probably need to change to a different sample since I do not have enough elution to do a gradient at all three of those amounts at 8 samples per amount (to create the gradient)- ask Caroline & Brooke their opinions

1. Add Buffer, dNTP, and Primers vortex to eppendorf tube. Vortex Briefly 
*(DO NOT vortex polymerase or albumin)*
2. Add polymerase and albumin. 
*albumin is viscous so pipet slowly*
3. Pipette 5.25 µL of master mix to each pcr tube.
4. Add 18.75 µL of water to the 1 uL & negative control tubes, pipette up and down to mix.
5. Add 17.75 µL of water to the 2 uL tubes, pipette up and down to mix.
6. Add 15.75 µL of water to the 4 uL tubes, pipette up and down to mix.
7. Pipette DNA into each tube
*use new pipette tip for each tube*
8. briefly centrifuge pcr tubes before thermal cycler
9. run thermocycler program: *38 cycles takes ~ 2 hours
    1. 95°C for 30 seconds
    2. 95°C for 30 seconds
    3. 46°C for 1 minute
    4. 68°C for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">30 seconds</mark> _repeat 2-4 for 38 cycles (# of cycles varies depending on input)
    5. 68°C for 5 minutes
    6. 8°C for Forever

### Tube Label Key 
**1A:** T3_39 w/ 1 uL
**1B:** T3_39 w/ 2 uL 
**1C:** T3_39 w/ 4 uL 
**2A:** T2_55 w/ 1 uL
**2B:** T2_55 w/ 2 uL
**2C:** T2_55 w/ 4 uL

### Sample Location 
Post PCR Fridge in box "PAN_BDT CNAT psbA Troubleshooting Box #1"

## Notes to Myself 
extracted DNA samples have 54 uL leftover
