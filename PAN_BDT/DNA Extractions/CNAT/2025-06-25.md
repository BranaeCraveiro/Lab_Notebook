*note: During the inhibitor removal step, two tubes of supernatant were collected - one with 400 μL, as called for by the protocol, and a second with 200 μL. For the 200 μL tube, 67.5 μL of P2, 100 μL of cHTR, and 367.5 μL of X1 buffer were used, followed by two 25 μL elution rounds. All tubes were incubated in elution buffer for 15 minutes.*
