*notes: DNA extraction concentrations lower than expected, saved disruptor tubes with tissue lysis in fridge after extraction to use the rest of the remaining solution to perform another DNA extraction (continuing from inhibitor removal step) on 6/18/2025. Changes made during the 6/18 extraction included allowing the elution buffer to incubated from 15 minutes in spin columns before centrifuging and thoroughly mixing each DNA extraction before qubiting by gently vertexing for 2 seconds on a low setting.*
