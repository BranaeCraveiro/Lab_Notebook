#### Last DNA extraction I had DNA in my negative, discussed plan moving forward:
- label sides of collection tubes 
- perform an extraction on thursday expect make three negatives, qubit to check for contamination of reagents
	- if contaminated start a new kit, if not assess what to do next and what I am comfortable with 

### To do next week:
- create primer stock - Caroline will probably do this for me 
- finish CNAT extractions
- do annealing temperature gradient

## 7/3/2025 Caroline & Brooke
### To do 
- pick day next week to help caroline with ITS2 PCR 
- Read thermofisher website on sanger sequencing

### Papers determining CNAT is dominated by Clade B 
#### Locatelli & Baums 2025 
*Genomes of the Caribbean reef-building corals Colpophyllia natans, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Siderastrea siderea* 10.1093/g3journal/jkaf020
- Found Breviolum contigs in CNAT symbiont metagenome.
- ITS2 sequencing matched Breviolum type (B4).
- psbA reference sequences were limited or missing.
#### Lewis et al. 2018 
*New Species of Closely Related Endosymbiotic Dinoflagellates in the Greater Caribbean have Niches Corresponding to Host Coral Phylogeny* 10.1093/g3journal/jkaf020
- evidence of CNATâ€“Breviolum mutualism.
- Figure 3 shows CNAT as one of breviolum host corals.
- psbA^ncr used to define breviolum species boundaries.
#### Cunning et al. 2023 
*Measuring multi-year changes in the Symbiodiniaceae algae in Caribbean corals on coral-depleted reefs.* 10.7717/peerj.17358
- Multi-year ITS2 survey across Caribbean reefs.
- _C. natans_ consistently dominated by **Breviolum**, rarely Cladocopium.

### Buying psbA primers
**Lewis et al. 2018** used psbA primers from **Thornhill & Lajuenesse 2011**  (10.1371/journal.pone.0029013) 

**psbAFor_1**        5' - GCA GCT CAT GGT TAT TTT GGT AGA C - 3'
**psbARev_1**       5' - AAT TCC CAT TCT CTA CCC ATC C - 3

*Caroline emailed someone who was working on psbA asking for primers for Clade B, the ones in the emailed matched the ones above :) 
- *additionally primers generally work with Clade D* 
### To do:
- Look at annealing temperatures - Q5 hot start high fidelity DNA polymerase KIT (T_M) new england biolabs
- also look at NEB dna polymerase kit protocol
## 7/1/2025 w/ Caroline
### To do:
- look at other papers to figure out CNAT dominant Clade 
- read other papers to figure out which species are also dominant in Breviolum & Durusdinium (clade B & clade D) to begin next for DNA extraction 

*Good authors for psbA & ITS2:*
- Daniel Thornhill
- Todd Lajuenesse 
- Benjamin Hume
