## T1_STRI Reef
#### CNAT Bleached or Pale* 
*having trouble determining CLP and CLB (most divers labeled CLP for everything)*
CNAT 5: 
CNAT 6: 
CNAT 16:
CNAT 23:
CNAT 26:
#### MCAV 09 and 10 P or H (were both H)
*092022 and 102023 seem to be CLP based on comparing the color to the sand- we labeled Healthy by divers* 
MCAV 8: 
#### MCAV DC (where??)
*072024 sample notes say DC 30% - not sure where the DC is that they are noting based on the colony pictures* 
MCAV 11:
#### SSID second opinion 
*labeled as Healthy CLP, CLP- wonder if this SSID is actually naturally very pale and is healthy at all timepoints*
SSID 10:
## T2_Juan Point
#### DC dark brown spot ( CNATs)
*very very dark brown spots - normal or DC?* 
CNAT 33:
CNAT 34: 
#### MCAV P or H (Healthy at all timepoints)
*I think some of our samples for this MCAV maybe be CLP- wanted to double check before changing since all labeled healthy by divers* 
MCAV 32:
#### SSID possible DC? (was labeled DC in 92022)
*cannot determine between DC or maybe the DC is the real color and the SSID is CLP* 
SSID 59: 

## T3_Crawl Cray
#### 092022 P or H? - 102023 called 100% CLP
*102023 was called pale and 092022 was called healthy - look about the same to me*
CNAT 60:
#### double check DC (brown patches)
*can't tell if dark brown is natural color or DC* 
CNAT 76
#### is the orange normal? (SSID)
*orange around edges and competition- cant tell if DC or natural color and the rest of SSID is pale*
SSID 84:

#### pale or healthy second opinion (MCAV)
*labeled healthy CLP healthy- Having a hard time since MCAV naturally pale- thinking CLP, Healthy, CLP* 
MCAV 69:

#### would purple like this be DC (SSID) they said 80% DC dark blue?
*having a little bit of trouble determining what blue counts as CLP and as DC* 
SSID 85: 
## T4_Rhino Reef
#### Possible DC on ORBI
*having a hard time determining if DC or CLP- seems more dramatic than natural variation*
ORBI 5:
#### weird white spots?
*not sure if fish predation or just normal bleaching* 
SSID 9:
## T5 Punta Caracol 
#### 072024 cnat dc slight greying?
*I might be crazy but the CLP looks a little grey? maybe DC?*
CNAT 56:
#### 072024 Healthy or Pale CNAT (were called H)
*Thinking these CNATs are CLP however were called Healthy and now I'm unconfident in my opinion lol*
CNAT 60:
CNAT 90:
#### 102023 bl or h (labeled h) PAST
*having a hard time with the lighting- however thinking some of these may be CLB* 
PAST 75:
PAST 78:
PAST 79:
PAST 82:
#### CNAT 072024 was CLP looks healthy to me???
*CNAT was called CLP but looks healthy- really confusing when even lighter CNATs were called Healthy*
CNAT 73:
#### is the greying on the outside normal?
*not sure if this counts as DC or natural variation at the perimeter* 
DLAB 44:
DLAB 47:
#### SSID 83 072024 P or H - SSID same color are labeled pale
*The one SSID I would call CLP is Healthy, but the rest I would call Healthy are CLP- very confused* 
SSID 83:
SSID 85:
SSID 86:
SSID 88: 
## T6_CK14
#### can someone double check hs
*was called Healthy all timepoints, want to double check (I put CLP for both)*
