**round one:**
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_9_MCAV  -->  qubit reading: 9.39
062019_BEL_CBC_T1_3_MCAV --> qubit reading: 2.81
062019_BEL_CBC_T2_5_MCAV --> qubit reading: 17.6
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_6_MCAV --> qubit reading: "too low"
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_16_MCAV --> qubit reading: "too low"

**round two:**
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_8_MCAV  -->  qubit reading: 3.67 
062019_BEL_CBC_T1_24_MCAV  -->  qubit reading: 6.83
062019_BEL_CBC_T1_20_MCAV  -->  qubit reading: 4.83
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_21_MMEA  -->  qubit reading: "too low"
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_4_PAST  -->  qubit reading: "too low"

**still to do:**
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_15_MCAV  
062019_BEL_CBC_T2_21_PAST 

**complications:**
062019_BEL_CBC_T3_25_PAST - can't find sample (no T3 PAST according to colony data)
052022_BEL_CBC_T2_69_OANN - no location of enriched sample

**notes:**
round one was done in the lab equipment stockroom, which does not have a working UV light. UV lighted everything inside the lab under sterile hood (filter need to be changed hence why I could not use our lab one) and carried it into stockroom.
