| Well 1                       | Well 2 | Well 3 | Well 4 | Well 5    | Well 6                      |

**Notes:** 
- Ran gel at 110 volts for 55 minutes; uneven gel (thicker by wells, thinner by positive electrode) lead to wobbly band pattern 
- Should run PCR samples again in a future gel to ensure missing samples are from a gel loading error and not a PCR error.

**Notes:** 
- Loaded samples 1, 2, 3, and 96 again to check source of error for missing samples in April7_2024_gel. 
- Ran for 35 minutes at 110 volts (Image April14_2025_Gel_1). Gel was thicker and more even than April 4, 2025 attempt, leading to even band pattern. 
- Ran for an additional 30 minutes (65 minutes total) at 110 volts (April14_2025_Gel_2), 90% certain that the gel was placed in the correct orientation. Do not know what caused the sample to smudge together, or the PCR samples to disappear. 
- Ran for an another 30 minutes (95 minutes total) at 110 volts (April14_2025_Gel_3), smudging got worse, sample began to disappear?
