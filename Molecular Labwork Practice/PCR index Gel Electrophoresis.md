Box: *PCR index 3/12 1-96* ("BRC Practice Samples")

**Notes:** 
- Ran for 35 minutes at 110 volts, wanted more separation between bands so attempted to run gel again for 25 minutes. However, forgot to hit the run button, so gel never ran. After realizing mistake, ran gel for 30 minutes at 110 volts (65 minutes total)
- Realized I never mixed PCR samples (pipetting up and down), leading to only one 16S sample (300-400 bp) appearing in gel (Lower bands are primer dimers)

Box: *PCR index 3/12 1-96* ("BRC Practice Samples")

**Notes:** 
- Loaded samples 1, 2, 3, and 96 again to check source of error for missing samples in April7_2024_gel. 
- Ran for 35 minutes at 110 volts. Gel was thicker and more even than April 4, 2025 attempt, leading to even band pattern. 
- Ran for an additional 30 minutes (65 minutes total) at 110 volts, 90% certain that the gel was placed in the correct orientation. Do not know what caused the sample to smudge together, or the PCR samples to disappear. 
- Ran for an another 30 minutes (95 minutes total) at 110 volts, smudging got worse, sample began to disappear?

Box: *PCR index 3/12 1-96* ("BRC Practice Samples")

**Notes:** 
- Ran gel at 110 volts for 55 minutes; uneven gel (thicker by wells, thinner by positive electrode) lead to wobbly band pattern 
- Should run PCR samples again in a future gel to ensure missing samples are from a gel loading error and not a PCR error.
