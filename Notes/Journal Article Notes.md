*Measuring multi-year changes in the Symbiodiniaceae algae in Caribbean corals on coral-depleted reefs*. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.17358 
### Intro: 
- corals can respond to changing enviroments through phenotypic plasticity, genetic adaption of host/symbionts, and switching symbionts 
	- adaptive bleaching hypothesis (Buddemeier & Fautin, 1993): shifts in symbiont species can help corals respond to increasing temps. 
### Methods
- temporal study (3 time points; 3 locations; 160 samples across 75 tagged colonies) testing variation of Symbiodiniaceae in 9 stony coral species (OANN, MCAV, OFAV, OFRA, PFUR, DLAB, CNAT, SSID, PSTR) at St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands.
	- sampled 1 month before being hit by 2 Category 5 hurricanes
	- after storms 28% of colonies were presumed dead (lots of corals were dislodged or missing)
- used ITS2 & SymPortal to identify symbiont taxa
### Results 
coral-algal symbiosis: 
- CNAT, DLAB, PSTR: dominated by Breviolum, sometimes Cladocopium (2 CNATS were Durusdinium dominated)
- OANN, OFAV, OFRA, MCAV: dominated by Cladocopium; rarely Symbiodinium/Breviolum
- SSID: ominated by Cladocopium
- PFUR: associated with ominated by Cladocopium/Symbiodinium in varying proportions 
ITS2 type profiles were mostly (not completely) species-specific
-  host-Breviolum specificity in CNAT, DLAB, PSTR, MCAV; OFRA & SSID Breviolum dom profiles commonly found in other host species 
	- pairwise alignment between hosts showed significant differences in composition
- host-Cladocopium specificity in ORBI spp. (composition of clade C seq. was not different among Orbi species), MCAV, DLAB, SSID, PFUR; CNAT & PSTR (when dominated by clade C) shared same profile w/ similar seq. variation. 
	- composition of Cladocopium seq. variants between species differed for all but DLAB & PFUR (restricted by low sample #) 
- Symbiodinium and Durusdinium profiles  showed host species-specific associations but not enough samples to be confident 
Changes in the dominant symbiont profile over time were uncommon; only occured in 1 CNAT (D -> B), 1 OANN (S -> C), 2 OFRA (C  -> B)

*Symbiodinium thermophilum sp. nov., a thermotolerant symbiotic alga prevalent in corals of the world’s hottest sea, the Persian/Arabian Gulf.* https://doi.org/10.1038/srep08562 
### Intro: 
- phylogenetic analysis of four genetic markers to describe Symbiodinium thermophilum, sp. nov. from the Persian/Arabian Gulf, a newly discovered thermally tolerant coral symbiont.
- psbA gene resolves S.thermophilum as a monophyletic lineage with large genetic distances from any other ITS2 C3 type found outside the Gulf.
- Persian/Arabian Gulf corals are able to cope with exceptionally high seasonal temperature maxima (34-36C) as well as large (20C) annual fluctuations
- ITS2 were expected corals in this area to be clade D (thermotolerant strain nased on past research), however 60% came back at clade C (considered thermosensititve), wanted to investigate what was going on 
	- want to answer: is the clade C prevelance a temporal, and clade D will come back seasonally/  permentally to clade D 
	- Gulf ITS2 type C3 Symbiodinium acutally a unresolved by ITS2 type phylotyping and genetically distinct from ITS2 type C3 Symbiodinium found exterior to the Gulf?
- Gulf C3 as resolved by the ITS2, cp23S, cob and psbAncr markers represent a new species that we have named Symbiodinium thermophilum; represents the predominant symbiont of corals from the southern Gulf, the world’s hottest sea.
### Study Design
ITS2 DGGE analysis to identify symbionts in 6 species of southern Gulf (Saadiyat) corals (3 colonies each) at each of 8 seasonal time points across 2 years (138 datapoints); predominance of Gulf ITS2 type C3 Symbiodinium in 89% of samples. 
### Results
- Porites spp. was dominated by Gulf ITS2 type C3 Symbiodinium, performed phylogenetic resolution of Gulf C3 using the cp23S, cob and psbAncr markers on these porites samples
- C3-Gulf ITS2 variant is defined specifically by that single 8-bp duplication-  wasn't enough to produce a distinct band in the DGGE analysis 
	- used different markers to check for new species 
		- cp23S: Gulf C3 is somewhat distinct but not resolved clearly
		- cob: Gulf C3 is unique relative to other C-types.
		- psbA ncr:  Gulf C3 is clearly, deeply distinct, with genetic distances exceeding distances between recognized species-level types.
	- cp23S, cob, and especially psbA ncr all converge on the conclusion that Gulf C3 is a separate species-level lineage
### Discussion 
- contrasted findings where clade D was predominant in other regions of the Gulf; this study shows  Gulf C3 is the predominant in this region (even in winter - not temporal)
- Clade D in the past has been characterized as opportunistic, replacing previously dominant strains lost during bleaching; chances might reflect increases in thermal resilience but may reduce energetic efficiency or reproductive success
- rarity of clade D in southern Gulf may be due to might suggest that high salinity, and wider ranger between summer high and winter low temps may limit the proliferation of clade D and promote C 
- C3-Gulf ITS2 variant as regional marker; rare ITS2 variant consistently appears in Gulf corals; useful marker for Gulf C3 populations even if not present in all individuals.
- Clade C has been characterized as thermally sensitive in the past; clade C might have greater phenotypical plasticity than thought 
- Concerted evolution masks ITS2 diversity; multiple copies of ITS2 in the genome prevent rare variants from being detected, explaining why ITS2 alone can’t resolve Gulf C3 as a distinct species that other markers (psbAncr, cp23S, cob) revealed. 
- Gulf C3 satisfies multiple species concepts: it is sexually isolated (psbAncr), genetically distinct (cp23S, cob, psbAncr), and occupies a unique ecological niche (extreme heat and salinity).

*Symbiodiniaceae diversity varies by host and environment across thermally distinct reefs* 
*https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.17342* 
### Main Goal: 
Understand how coral species and environmental conditions shape symbiont diversity using high-resolution markers (psbA and ITS2).
### Key Questions:
- Do specific corals associate with specific symbionts?
- How does temperature influence symbiont communities?
- Is there co-phylogeny between hosts and symbionts (evidence of coevolution)?
### Study Design 
**Location:** Coral Sea Marine Park, Australia
**Time:** Feb-Mar 2020
Samples collected from 13 reefs with different thermal profiles
**3 coral species:** Pocillopora verrucosa, Pocillopora meandrina, Acropora humilis
Dna extraction -> PCR amplification of ITS2 & psbA ncr -> sequencing 
### Findings: 
- symbiont diversity is influenced by host species, transmission (vertical vs. horizontal) and enviroment 
	- Some corals always host the same symbionts, while others vary based on local conditions.
	- A. cf. humilis (horitzontal transmitting) symbiont diversity were seperated acording to thermal history (both historical and contemporary) experienced by each reef
		- the effect of historical thermal stress (DHW between 1985 and 2020) explained 2x as much symbiont variation as the bleaching event in 2020, suggesting that symbiont communities mainly shift after (not during) a bleaching event
		- Durusdinium (common in horizontally transmitting species) not found in humilis highlighting niche durisdinium requirements for in shore reefs 
- Different markers show different patterns: ITS2 captures fine-scale diversity; psbA shows broader, species-level patterns; Using both gives a fuller picture
- Host-symbiont coupling strength varies: 
		- P. verrucosa = strong control by host
		- A. cf. humilis = more influenced by environment
		- P. meandrina = in between
	- vertical transmitting species showed Cophylogeny (coevolution) while horizontal transmitting species show weak evolutionary stability 
	- P. meandrina has symbiont strains divided by north & south reefs, currents during larval dispersion may explain this 
- Environmental drivers matter: Temperature, light, and depth shape symbiont communities across reefs.
	- acropora are the most thermally sensititve, corresponds to symbiont being mostly influenced by environment (mainly all thermal and irradiance parameters)
	- looking at 3 most dominant genetic clustering of acropora there was clear link between bleaching and symbiont community changes ( just looking at most dominant showed no link); suggests that the bleaching vulnerability and resulting changes in symbiont community are not evenly distributed across the entire coral species (must consider both the bleaching condition and the specific genetic background of the host coral)
	- P. verrucosa maintains symbiont community after bleaching, while P. meandrina can change in response to bleaching 
- Climate change implications: Corals with flexible symbiont associations may be more resilient to stress and bleaching.
	- Humilis with C3k ‘max’ symbionts might foster higher thermal tolerance as it is located in reefs which have experienced historically higher DHW and highlights a potential source of increased resilience for A. cf humilis in response to rapid environmental change. 
	- each bleaching event forces the coral to rebuild its symbiont community, and repeated disturbances can lead to a permanent shift towards a more heat-tolerant symbiont community.

I*mproved Resolution of Reef-Coral Endosymbiont (Symbiodinium) Species Diversity, Ecology, and Evolution through psbANon-Coding Region Genotyping* 
[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029013)
### Problem: 
Two previous studies using ITS2 to analyzed symbiont composition in Montipora spp. found conflicting results
- LaJeunesse et al. found two Symbiodinium ITS2 lineages within hosts; used PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis)
- Stat et al. found communities have many different symbiont ITS2 types within each colony with overall endosymbiont diversity greater within than between hosts; used PCR and bacterial cloning
ITS2 is part of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, which is a multi-copy gene, meaning many copies exist within the genome of a single organism- leading high level of intragenomic variation and overestimation of  diversity. 
### Solution:
Plastid DNA markers, such as the psbAncr, are more akin to single-copy loci in that they exhibit relatively low intragenomic variation and their use may reduce uncertainty when evaluating genetic diversity.
### Methods:
**Locations:** O’ahu, Hawaii, the Great Barrier Reef, Australia,  Zamami Island, Japan, Zanzibar, Tanzania, and the Andaman Sea, Thailand. 
**Coral:** *Montipora* spp.
-  PCR to amplify ITS2 & psbAncr
### Findings
- Montipora spp. screened using ITS2-DGGE to look at genetic diveristy
	- found 4 distinctive types & many of the C31 profiles contained a second band that might be evidence of codominant intragenomic ITS2 variant or a second close-related symbiont
	- mixed symbiont population comprising C31c and D1-4-6 was detected in one sample
- Sequencing of 70 cloned ITS2 fragments from 5 coral colonies revealed 33 distinct variants (27 from Clade C, 6 from Clade D).
	- Within individual colonies, cloned ITS2 sequences differed by 1–8 base substitutions, with the most common variant typically occupying a central “ancestral” position surrounded by rare singletons- suggesting one dominant symbiont type. 
	- Phylogenetic clustering showed no overlap between M. incrassata (C26a) and M. capitata (C31/C31c) symbiont sequences.
	- The dominant bacterially cloned sequences generally matched DGGE-detected bands, although cloning also recovered additional low-frequency variants (e.g., type C21) not observed by DGGE.
		- This incongruence between methods raises questions about whether rare variants represent: intragenomic ITS2 polymorphisms, PCR/cloning artifacts, or biologically distinct symbiodinium lineages co-occurring within a single host colony.
- direct sequencing of psbAncr showed single umbiguous sequence, suggesting low intragenomic variability
	- ranged from 536 - 601 bp in length & each symbiont lineage associated with a particular species of Montipora
- sequencing of bacterial clones revealed 2 to 5 distinct psbAncr sequences within each sample w/ the most most abundant sequence identical to the sequence obtained by direct sequencing
	- singletons that were not captured by direct sequencing very similar to the dominant haplotype, differing by only one or two nucleotide changes; low divergence suggests PCR artifacts, but may just represents low intragenomic variation within samples
	- psbAncr exhibits less within-sample heterogeneity- 2 to 5 distinct seq. per sample vs ITS2 with 6–9 diff. seq. per sample
	- psbA had much more intergenomic variation between symbiodinium types than ITS2
- PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced the psbAncr from three iso-clonal cultures of Clade C (C1, C2), factoring artifacts revealed intragenomic variation does exist for psbAncr
	- approximately 10-30% of cloned variants were probably artifacts of the bacterial cloning method cautions against over interpretation of small seq differ. for data generated following this method
	- psbAncr good for determining relationships between very closely related Symbiodinium species but doesn't work for distantly related species because some Symbiodinium lineages, like rt203, have multiple, highly variable copies of the psbAncr marker in their own genome
- Overall, the psbAncr phylogeny was similar the ITS2 phylogeny with individual samples exhibiting similar monophyly for each marker and clustered together based on geography and host origin.
	- ITS2 lineages separated by small sequence differences are well differentiated by the numerous base substitutions and insertion-deletions in  psbAncr, revealing geographic partitioning not resolved by ITS2 data.
