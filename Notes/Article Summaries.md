## Locatelli & Baums 2025 
*Genomes of the Caribbean reef-building corals Colpophyllia natans, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Siderastrea siderea* 10.1093/g3journal/jkaf020
- Found Breviolum contigs in CNAT symbiont metagenome.
- ITS2 sequencing matched Breviolum type (B4).
- psbA reference sequences were limited or missing.
## Lewis et al. 2018 
*New Species of Closely Related Endosymbiotic Dinoflagellates in the Greater Caribbean have Niches Corresponding to Host Coral Phylogeny* 10.1093/g3journal/jkaf020
- evidence of CNATâ€“Breviolum mutualism.
## Cunning et al. 2023 
*Measuring multi-year changes in the Symbiodiniaceae algae in Caribbean corals on coral-depleted reefs.* 10.7717/peerj.17358
- Multi-year ITS2 survey across Caribbean reefs.
- CNAT consistently dominated by Breviolum, rarely Cladocopium.
