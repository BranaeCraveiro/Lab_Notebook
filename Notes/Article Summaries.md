*Symbiodiniaceae diversity varies by host and environment across thermally distinct reefs* 10.1111/mec.17342
#### Main Goal: 
Understand how coral species and environmental conditions shape symbiont diversity using high-resolution markers (psbA and ITS2).
#### Key Questions:
- Do specific corals associate with specific symbionts?
- How does temperature influence symbiont communities?
- Is there co-phylogeny between hosts and symbionts (evidence of coevolution)?
#### Study Design 
**Location:** Coral Sea Marine Park, Australia
**Time:** Feb–Mar 2020
Samples collected from 13 reefs with different thermal profiles
**3 coral species:** Pocillopora verrucosa, Pocillopora meandrina, Acropora humilis
#### Findings: 
- 








- Symbiont diversity depends on both coral host and environment.
- Some corals always host the same symbionts, while others vary based on local conditions.
- Different markers show different patterns: ITS2 captures fine-scale diversity; psbA shows broader, species-level patterns; Using both gives a fuller picture
- Host-symbiont coupling strength varies: 
	- P. verrucosa = strong control by host
	- A. cf. humilis = more influenced by environment
	- P. meandrina = in between
- Environmental drivers matter: Temperature, light, and depth shape symbiont communities across reefs.
- Climate change implications: Corals with flexible symbiont associations may be more resilient to stress and bleaching.

*Genomes of the Caribbean reef-building corals Colpophyllia natans, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Siderastrea siderea* 10.1093/g3journal/jkaf020
- Found Breviolum contigs in CNAT symbiont metagenome.
- ITS2 sequencing matched Breviolum type (B4).
- psbA reference sequences were limited or missing.

- evidence of CNAT–Breviolum mutualism.

- Multi-year ITS2 survey across Caribbean reefs.
- CNAT consistently dominated by Breviolum, rarely Cladocopium.
