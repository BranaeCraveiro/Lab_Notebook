TO DO 
- make a figure of healthy vs bleaches for the panama samples :) 
## 9/10/2025 w/ Caroline & Brooke
### Questions I want to ask 
- Should we make a google calendar or something to organize when I will be using the gel molds especially since my schedule is so variable with troubleshooting 
- any recommendations of how I should balance lab work with grant writing? I am struggle to stay on top of everything especially with my coursework
	- Caroline suggests to prioritize writing since those have hard deadlines opposed to personal (soft) deadline
### Brevolium Reference Genome 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965643015.1/ 
- use local blast to search primer sequence against brevolium genome. 
- talked to Nikea and since I got too many hits I need to used cutadapt on unity to figure out where both my forward and reverse primers are within genome (Brevolium has a HUGE genome)
	- will set up time to meet with Brandon so we can meet and run the job together since he has experience running this type of program before

### Interpreting Gel Results 
#### 300 bp & 700 bp Bands
My most recent gel ([9.2.2025 - Troubleshooting](../../PAN_BDT/psbA/9.2.2025%20-%20Troubleshooting.md)) show a ~300 bp band and a ~700 bp band. However, the paper I got my primer from shares that the psbAncr region was between 500-600 bp. 
- Sarah believe the next step is to figure out whay the 300 bp band is and if the 700 bp bands is actually the psbA region?
	- she says that we can perhaps reach out to Caleb in the Fuess lab as he has done psbAncr before see if he has thoughts on what the 300 bp band is and whether the ~700 is the target amplicon
	- or we can just sequence the 700 bp band and see, would just have to do a bead cleanup to get the 300 bp out my PCR samples
- Nikea says to use a genome browser to figure out what the lengths usually are in Breviolum since psbA is super conserved usually. 
	- she also said something about trying a local blast? need to ask more details on that since I am still new to explore genomic databases 
#### Non-specific Binding 
As I have been increasing my DNA load my non-specific binding has dissapeared. 
	**Sarahs thoughts on why:** raising the concentration is reducing the non-specific binding because you have a lot of non-target DNA (ie coral dna, microbe dna) in the samples and the primers aren't finding the right DNA. Therefore by increasing DNA load the primers can finally find the correct binding sites as there is more symbiont DNA.
