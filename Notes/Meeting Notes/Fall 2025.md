Hi Dr. Butler,

Thank you so much for the quick reply and for answering my question! I now have a new question, what should I do for samples where I am not getting a 700 bp amplicon

- I am a little silly and apparently cannot read, the WDHOF grant is due Oct. 31st, and not Oct. 1st. 
	-  which wdhof grant should i do?

- am almost done my Sigma Xi application! I think my struggle was simply getting started.
- can i ask you guys some silly logistic questions on my sigma xi application 
- ask brooke and caroline for phylogenic analysis tools on R I can wrtie a manual about for my bioinfomatic project

### Questions I want to ask 
- Should we make a google calendar or something to organize when I will be using the gel molds especially since my schedule is so variable with troubleshooting 
- any recommendations of how I should balance lab work with grant writing? I am struggle to stay on top of everything especially with my coursework
	- Caroline suggests to prioritize writing since those have hard deadlines opposed to personal (soft) deadline
### Brevolium Reference Genome 
#### Local Blast Attempt
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965643015.1/ (GCA_965643015.1)
- use local blast to search primer sequence against brevolium genome, however the primers came up with too many hit for this to yield any effective results. 
#### Searching published Brevolium psbAncr sequences
- Nikea did some digging on the NCBI database and found a list of published psbA ncr regions from Brevolium (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=psbA+minicircle%3B+chloroplast+Breviolum)
	- one of them match the paper that originally used the Thornhill & Lajuenesse 2011 primers on a DLAB sample 
		- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MH756051.1 Acession number: MH756051
	- 11 DCYL seq that range from 720 bp - 969 bp 
	- 2 MMEA seq that are ~1130 bp
	- 1 DLAB seq that is 1,454 bp
	I feel like the above numbers and enough to confirm that the 700 bp band in my gels is most likely my samples psbA region since the psbAncr sequences are spanning such a wide array of bp counts

### Interpreting Gel Results 
#### 300 bp & 700 bp Bands
My most recent gel ([9.2.2025 - Troubleshooting](../../PAN_BDT/psbA/9.2.2025%20-%20Troubleshooting.md)) show a ~300 bp band and a ~700 bp band. However, the paper I got my primer from shares that the psbAncr region was between 500-600 bp. 
- Sarah believe the next step is to figure out whay the 300 bp band is and if the 700 bp bands is actually the psbA region?
	- she says that we can perhaps reach out to Caleb in the Fuess lab as he has done psbAncr before see if he has thoughts on what the 300 bp band is and whether the ~700 is the target amplicon
	- or we can just sequence the 700 bp band and see, would just have to do a bead cleanup to get the 300 bp out my PCR samples
- Nikea says to use a genome browser to figure out what the lengths usually are in Breviolum since psbA is super conserved usually. 
	- she also said something about trying a local blast? need to ask more details on that since I am still new to explore genomic databases 
#### Non-specific Binding 
As I have been increasing my DNA load my non-specific binding has dissapeared. 
	**Sarahs thoughts on why:** raising the concentration is reducing the non-specific binding because you have a lot of non-target DNA (ie coral dna, microbe dna) in the samples and the primers aren't finding the right DNA. Therefore by increasing DNA load the primers can finally find the correct binding sites as there is more symbiont DNA.
