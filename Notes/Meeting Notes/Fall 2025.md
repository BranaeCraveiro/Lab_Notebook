## 9/25/2025 w/ Sarah, Caroline, & Brooke

- applied to sigma xi membership 
- waiting for email back from caleb 
	- asked him what I should do for samples that are not showing a 700 bp band 
### main concerns with psbA right now 
- why my samples arent all showing a 700 bp band
- why a majority of my samples actually show the 300 bp band and not the 700 bp band
	- is it because my host biomass is outweighing the symbiont biomass- so my host DNA is overwhleming the symbiont DNA? 
- Caleb says there is the possibility of there being two psbA seuqences in my samples- does that mean two different symbionts or one symbiont with mutliple psbA regions (is that possible)
### other questions related to project
- am I going to have to troubleshoot like this for every species
- bleached corals is still a big mystery not excited about that 
	- ig if we really want to see if the 300 bp band is from the host we could run a PCR on a bleached colony but still there is no way of knowing if there are absolutely no symbionts in the coral samples

## 9/17/2025 w/ Caroline & Brooke 
### To Do 
- draft email to Caleb (CalebCButler@txstate.edu)- post doc who's phd advisor was Todd LaJeunesse
	In my email I need to include:
		- briefly introduce myself include my lab  
		- upload most recent image (make sure to clearly annotate it)
		- explain what I am seeing in my gel and what I am concerned about
		- explain the brevolium genome database searching I did and why I think the 700 bp is my psbA region and ask for his opinion
#### Caroline's tips: 
- keep major question in bold in its own sentence right after introducing myself- they do not want to be search the emailing for it. 
- Keep it straight foward do not over explain yourself, they are also a coral biologist and if they need more detail it is better they ask then bore them with a long email 
- always can ask follow up questions later- do not ask too much from them at once 

### Caleb's Email Response notes 
Recieved on 9/18
- psbAncr can show intragenomic variation, usually less pronounced than ITS2
	- Intragenomic variation: multiple slightly different copies of the psbA ncr exist within a single symbiont genome; differences are usually small (SNPs or indels) and typically do not produce separate gel bands.
- Smaller bands (e.g., 300 bp) may result from PCR artifacts or host DNA amplification; in rare cases, they could reflect multiple psbA variants
- The expected psbAncr amplicon size is generally 700â€“1400 bp; the 700 bp band is likely the correct target so he suggests to sequence it and see what that yields 
## 9/10/2025 w/ Caroline & Brooke
### Questions I want to ask 
- any recommendations of how I should balance lab work with grant writing? I am struggle to stay on top of everything especially with my coursework
	- Caroline suggests to prioritize writing since those have hard deadlines opposed to personal (soft) deadline
### Brevolium Reference Genome 
#### Local Blast Attempt
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965643015.1/ (GCA_965643015.1)
- use local blast to search primer sequence against brevolium genome, however the primers came up with too many hit for this to yield any effective results. 
#### Searching published Brevolium psbAncr sequences
- Nikea did some digging on the NCBI database and found a list of published psbA ncr regions from Brevolium (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=psbA+minicircle%3B+chloroplast+Breviolum)
	- one of them match the paper that originally used the Thornhill & Lajuenesse 2011 primers on a DLAB sample 
		- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MH756051.1 Acession number: MH756051
	- 11 DCYL seq that range from 720 bp - 969 bp 
	- 2 MMEA seq that are ~1130 bp
	- 1 DLAB seq that is 1,454 bp
	I feel like the above numbers and enough to confirm that the 700 bp band in my gels is most likely my samples psbA region since the psbAncr sequences are spanning such a wide array of bp counts

### Interpreting Gel Results 
#### 300 bp & 700 bp Bands
My most recent gel ([9.2.2025 - Troubleshooting](../../PAN_BDT/psbA/9.2.2025%20-%20Troubleshooting.md)) show a ~300 bp band and a ~700 bp band. However, the paper I got my primer from shares that the psbAncr region was between 500-600 bp. 
- Sarah believe the next step is to figure out whay the 300 bp band is and if the 700 bp bands is actually the psbA region?
	- she says that we can perhaps reach out to Caleb in the Fuess lab as he has done psbAncr before see if he has thoughts on what the 300 bp band is and whether the ~700 is the target amplicon
	- or we can just sequence the 700 bp band and see, would just have to do a bead cleanup to get the 300 bp out my PCR samples
- Nikea says to use a genome browser to figure out what the lengths usually are in Breviolum since psbA is super conserved usually. 
	- she also said something about trying a local blast? need to ask more details on that since I am still new to explore genomic databases 
#### Non-specific Binding 
As I have been increasing my DNA load my non-specific binding has dissapeared. 
	**Sarahs thoughts on why:** raising the concentration is reducing the non-specific binding because you have a lot of non-target DNA (ie coral dna, microbe dna) in the samples and the primers aren't finding the right DNA. Therefore by increasing DNA load the primers can finally find the correct binding sites as there is more symbiont DNA.
