questions for sarah when I get back:
- for goldwater I need to specify which area I would like my reviewer to be from (Life Sciences areas of specialization), what one is best? -- go to website and show her the list 
- talk about what projects I should include 
	- does health status assessments counts? 
	- photoquadrants? 
	- obviously my current big project is the main one
